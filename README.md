QuantumLight - Investment Intern
- Data-driven VC fund founded by Nik Storonsky, Founder/CEO of Revolut. Received an offer from Imperial to study Computer Science, but realised I learn better by doing. Joined QuantumLight so I could speak to more founders and learn about more spaces and startups. Learning to work with and lead developers since the team is ~75% engineers. Spend most of my day analysing startups, but also building simple workflow automations to make internal processes more efficient. Also, learning about ML and data science which is cool!
